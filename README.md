# Education
Recording all articles about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) I have been reading or would like to read 

Codes snippest I wrote along the way

This repository will serve as an index of my general science and engineering education.

### Topics
1. Computer Science and Engineering

2. Electrical Engineering

3. Mechanical Engineering

4. Mathematics

5. Physics

...

Track of all the resources that I use to help document my growth as an engineer, as well as to help serve as a general engineering education resource aggregator for others.
