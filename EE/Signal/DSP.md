## Minimum phase and Control

Definition
Systems that are causal and stable whose inverses are causal and unstable are known as 
non-minimum-phase systems. A given non-minimum phase system will have a greater phase contribution than the minimum-phase system with the equivalent magnitude response.

[Minimum Phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_phase)

A minimum-phase system should NOT have any poles or zeros in the open right half of s-plane.
The effectively imply that the mimimum-phase system has to be at least Lyapunov stable if not asymptotically stable
