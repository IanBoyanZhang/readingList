Power integrating sensor??

Dynamic range of power modes of MCU in datasheet

The resolution can be considered better than 1ppm and 10nA.

Two common approaches for calculating energy usage

1. The V-I-T method

2. The delta E method

Conclusion:

V-I-T method allows peak current to be observed. As long as the events are long enough duration to be sampled effectively by the A/D converter.
The bandwidth of the current-voltage op amp system and the conversion rate define the system`s accuracy.
