"A three-state bus is typically used between chips on a single printed circuit board (PCB), or sometimes between PCBs plugged into a common backplane.

Usage of three-state logic is not recommended for on-chip connections but rather for inter-chip connections."

"Three-state buffers used to enable multiple devices to communicate on a data bus can be functionally replaced by a multiplexer.[4] That will help select output from a range of devices and write one to the bus."
