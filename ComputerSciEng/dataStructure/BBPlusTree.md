# B tree
Important properties of a B-tree

  B tree nodes have many more than two children
  
  A B tree node may contain more than just a single element

# B+ tree

A B+ Tree is best thought of a key-value store. It is structured as a generalized tree. Instead of having only one key in each node it has N keys in each node,
Where N is referred to as the degree of the B+ Tree. 

Interior nodes,
Exterior (leaf) nodes.
