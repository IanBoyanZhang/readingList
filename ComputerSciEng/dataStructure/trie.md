In CS, a tire also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes) 
ordered tree is used to store dynamic set or associative array

Where the keys are usually strings.

Binary Search Treee (BST): node in the tree stores the key associated with that node

Trie: node position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated

Description:

1. All the descendants of a node have a common associated with every node

2. Values tend only to be associated with leaves and with some innner nodes that correspond to keys of interest
