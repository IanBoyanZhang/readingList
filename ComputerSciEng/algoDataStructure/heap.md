# Heap (data structure)

Min heap
Max heap

"Heaps are crucial in several efficient graph algo such as"
Dijkstra algo
Heapsort

"A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is complete binary tree"

"The heap is one maximally efficient implementation of priority queue, and in fact queues are often referred to as 'heaps' "

## Operations 

(The ones that we are trying to implement)

Basic:

find-max/min

insert

extract-min/max

## Implementation
Heaps are usually implemented in an array (fixed size or dynamic array), and do not require pointers between elements. After an element is inserted into or deleted from
a heap, the heap property may be violated and the heap must be balacned by internal operations
