#Automata Theory

"Formal language theory is important in programming language design and is at the heart of modern compiler architectures. Automata theory contributes the concept of 
regular expression, used in many ways in pattern matching"

"Most important, computability theory, which can be considered a branch of automata theory, defines certain problems that have no solution"

'"Automata Theory" teaches you the very important equivalence between: 
  
  1. a language: some -- usually -- infinite set of strings

  2. a grammar: the finite set of rules to generate that language

  3. an automaton (not automation): the abstract processing device that can recognize that language
